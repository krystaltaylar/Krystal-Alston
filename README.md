# Hi there 

I'm Krystal Alston — a TripleTen Data Science graduate with a passion for data-driven problem solving and uncovering actionable insights through analytics. With hands-on experience in Python, machine learning, and real-world datasets, I enjoy turning complex challenges into clear, strategic solutions.

Here on my GitHub, you’ll find projects focused on predictive modeling, deep learning, time-series forecasting, and exploratory data analysis — all built with Python and tools like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Let’s connect and keep learning together!
